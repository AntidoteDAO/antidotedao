Toxic company culture is the No. 1 reason workers are quitting jobs. It is not just taking a toll on people’s physical and mental health but it is taking a toll on economy. First of all, because recovery from the toxic workplace takes time while people are not productive. Second, hiring and educating people is much more expensive than retaining them within a company.

Toxicity became a norm in a business. Lots of companies become *successful* in capitalist terms by exploiting and waisting people. And because those organisations hit the financial targets investors are pouring more money to sustain those toxic cultures effectively creating self-perpetuating cycle.

In the last few years, many companies started to set up *People departments* (instead of human resources) to highlight that they care about their employees and treat them as human beings. While there are some genuine attempts to make it work most of the organisations join the cargo cult by changing the wrapper but not the substance.

This is why we are creating the Antidote Community – a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) with a sole purpose to *detoxify workplaces for a better future*. Everyone can join the community to discuss, collaborate and develop ideas together with other members around (but not limited to) new ways to support mental health, educate or take a legal action.

By harnessing the power of web3, the members of the Antidote will drive, own, govern and create value with a help of our Social Token ($ANTDT). It will be granted for contribution towards the community purpose. If you want to change the way how we work [apply here](https://feo0eh7aoza.typeform.com/to/waunnGuo)
